abstract="This paper describes FrTime, an extension of Scheme designed for writing interactive applications. Inspired by functional reactive programming, the language embeds dynamic dataflow within a call-by-value functional language. The essence of the embedding is to make program expressions evaluate to nodes in a dataflow graph. This strategy eases importation of legacy code and permits incremental program construction. We have integrated FrTime with the DrScheme programming environment and have used it to develop several novel applications. We describe FrTime's design and implementation in detail and present a formal semantics of its evaluation model.",

This has proven incorrect in practice. SCRUM assumes that the systems development process is an unpredictable, complicated process that can only be roughly described as an overall progression. SCRUM defines the systems development process as a loose set of activities that combines known, workable tools and techniques with the best that a development team can devise to build systems. Since these activities are loose, controls to manage the process and inherent risk are used. SCRUM is an enhancement of the commonly used iterative/incremental object-oriented development cycle.",

    title={Analysis of companies’ experience with cross-platform development compared to native development for mobile devices}, 
    abstractNote={Today, there are a handful of different platforms for mobile phones. Writing an application natively for each mobile operating system is time consuming and expensive. This situation has created a need for using cross-platform frameworks, that allow programmers to create an application once and run it on all platforms. The problem is that it is not certain whether cross-platform apps can fully replace native ones, or if by using cross-platform tools some desired qualities are lost. Investigating this issue would allow to find out which one of these two application development methods is better, or in which situation it is better to choose one over the other. Such knowledge would allow to decrease development time and costs. Companies that create mobile applications on a daily basis have expertise in this area. Thus, thirteen interviews were done with thirteen distinct businesses in order to research this problem. The results showed that native development produces higher quality applications, but there are some situations where it might be better to use cross-platform frameworks. },

    title={Effects on performance and usability for cross-platform application development using React Native}, url={http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:liu:diva-130022}, 
    abstractNote={A big problem with mobile application development is that the mobile market is divided amongst several platforms. Because of this, development time gets longer, more development skills are needed and the application gets harder to maintain. A solution to this is cross-platform development, which allows you to develop an application for several platforms at the same time. Since September 2015 the cross-platform framework React Native, created by Facebook, has been available for public use. This thesis evaluates React Native, for both Android and iOS, in regards to performance, platform code sharing as well as look and feel. An application was developed for both platforms, one version using the native language and one version using React Native. The different versions were compared through automated test scenarios to evaluate performance, manual code review for platform code sharing and with a user study to evaluate the look and feel. The results show promise as the user study shows that the React Native versions of the application have similar user experiences as their native counterparts without significantly affecting performance. The results also show that for the specified application about 75\% of the React Native code could be used for both platforms, while it was easy to add platform-specific code.},

    title={React Native application development - A comparison between native Android and React Native},
    url={http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:liu:diva-131645}, 
    abstractNote={Creating a mobile application often requires the developers to create one for Android och one for iOS, the two leading operating systems for mobile devices. The two applications may have the same layout and logic but several components of the user interface (UI) will differ and the applications themselves need to be developed in two different languages. This process is gruesome since it is time consuming to create two applications and it requires two different sets of knowledge. There have been attempts to create techniques, services or frameworks in order to solve this problem but these hybrids have not been able to provide a native feeling of the resulting applications.This thesis has evaluated the newly released framework React Native that can create both iOS and Android applications by compiling the code written in React. The resulting applications can share code and consists of the UI components which are unique for each platform. The thesis focused on Android and tried to replicate an existing Android application in order to measure user experience and performance. The result was surprisingly positive for React Native as some user could not tell the two applications apart and nearly all users did not mind using a React Native application. The performance evaluation measured GPU frequency, CPU load, memory usage and power consumption. Nearly all measurements displayed a performance advantage for the Android application but the differences were not protruding.The overall experience is that React Native a very interesting framework that can simplify the development process for mobile applications to a high degree. As long as the application itself is not too complex, the development is uncomplicated and one is able to create an application in very short time and be compiled to both Android and iOS.},

  abstract={The app-industry today is ruled by two giants, namely Android and iOS. For companies and developers, it is essential to deliver their product to the majority of users, thus adapting to both platforms. The platforms involve their own way of developing applications and only barely resembles each other. A problem that the industry faces resides here, having to hire staff with knowledge in either Android or iOS, or both, to build two separate applications that in turn require parallel upkeep. Cross-platform frameworks that could bridge this gap have come and gone, not succeeding in creating applications with the same visual or functional standard as the native frameworks deliver. Facebook has announced a new framework named React Native that promises to deliver a fully native experience with the use of only one code base. This thesis revolves around an evaluation of this framework, focusing on the development side, system performance and the user experience that React Native delivers. We found that the users, when testing both a React Native application in comparison with native application separately, did not notice any difference, but when the applications were placed side by side all participants could distinguish the two systems. The overall quality of React Native encompasses more than development time and implementation, and we found a more situational recommendation to be adequate, thus addressing all underlying issues. The end result shows that React Native applications are currently not as good as native applications regarding the user experience nor performance, but it demonstrates the capabilities of cross-platform reducing the existing gap between them. We anticipate our thesis to be a starting point for developers, deciding if they should select a native or cross-platform implementation.},

    abstractNote={The world of mobile phones is currently inhabited by three large rivals. We have Apple with their iOS devices, Microsoft with the Windows Phone line, and various devices with Googles Android operating system. Developing for all platforms individually is labour intensive and time consuming. Therefore cross-platform development is of interest for companies large as small. The technique which gives performance closest to native development is called cross compiling, which compiles native applications from a common codebase. This thesis takes a closer look at the performance of the tool Xamarin Platform, in which applications for iOS, Windows Phone and Android can be created. The performance of Xamarin Platform applications on iOS and Android is native for most user interface components. Network performance is native or better. However computational tasks are very slow compared to natively developed applications. Xamarin PlatformWindows Phone applications are not covered by this thesis.},
